## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead, please send an email to the maintainer or report it via GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" tab if enabled.

We will try to review the report as soon as possible and provide a fix or a workaround.
